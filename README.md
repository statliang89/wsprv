wsprv: weighted selection probability for rare variant analysis.
This package is developed to locate individual rare variants after a multiple-phenotype based group test finds significance.
It takes a long time to compute weighted selection probabilities for individual rare variants when the bootstrap replication is large and a large number of rare variants exists.
We recommend users to use 'rep=100' to compute the weighted selection probability each rare variant.
In order to decrease the computation time in examples, we only use 'rep=5' to compute weighted selection probabilities.
